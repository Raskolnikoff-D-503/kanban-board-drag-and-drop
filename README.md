## About The Project

The Kanban Board project was made with the purpose to explore drag & drop technology and implement it in something useful. This kanban board might be used in a very simple Scrum Workflow. 

So one of the main features of the project is the ability to switch tasks order between each other and between boards by just simply dragging task elements.

There is also an ability to add new tasks while choosing their type, based on suggested colors. Tasks are being saved to local storage.

The problem with adding as much tasks as possible without changing the size of boards was solved by simply adding scrollbar inside board content elements.

So here it is. I had fun doing it and had a lot to change while creating the kanban board project just to make it as good as possible. Still, it's pretty much a simple project.
